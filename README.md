# K-Nearest-Neighbors-Script
A python script that determines the quality of red wine based on the its features.

# Instructions
Have the csv file in the same directory of this script and run it. The script uses the dataset from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality

# Initial Goals From Finishing This Project
- Learn about classification with k nearest neighbors [x]
- Create my own algorithm for a practicle dataset [x]

# What I Learned
In this project I learned the concept of classifcation with k nearest neighbors.

# Things I Can Improve On/ Do In The Future
The accuracy of script is around 50%. I could improve it to be more accurate. I think I needed a more diverse dataset/training set to get better results. The training set I used contains mostly red wine of the same quality.

# Thought Process Throughout The Project
I wanted to learn about machine learning. I started to watch Sentdex tutorial on machine learning. I watched his videos on how to use machine learning practically and that inspired me to try to create a simple algorithm. The algorithm I created is simple. It checks the euclidean distance between the predicted data and the training set.

# Time It Took To Complete This Project
Couple of hours.
